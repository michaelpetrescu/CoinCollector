I have created a game that I have based off of Taappy Tap App from computing lessons.
It is a 3D game where you control a ball and you try to pick up yellow coins.This represents tapping on a blue circle in the app.
You need to avoid bumping into red coins. This represents tapping a red circles.
There are also some obstacles although they don't really have much of a purpose other than to be in the wayy of the player.
You move forward and backward with W and S and turn with A and D.
I changed the timer to 20 seconds since 15 felt way too short.
I created this game in Unity using C#. I built the game using the WebGL platform so it could be played in a browser.

I have hosted the game on a secure server with an SSL certificate, malware, and DDoS protection.
The game is located at https://cardshoponline.co.uk/Coin%20Collector/index.html
*The domain I used seems unrelaeted because it is an unrelated one that I already owned.
